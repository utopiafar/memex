## What is Memex?

Memex is an open-source, local-first AI journal for iOS and Android. It takes a different approach from traditional journaling apps — instead of asking you to sit down and write polished entries, Memex lets you capture life in fragments (text, photos, voice) and uses a multi-agent AI system to organize them into structured timeline cards, extract knowledge, and surface insights across your records.

Under the hood, Memex's multi-agent intelligence is powered by a fully open Custom Agent System — you can use the same engine to orchestrate and run your own agents. If you're curious about building autonomous workflows on your phone, [jump straight to the details](#-custom-agent-system).

**What "local-first" means here:** Your records, cards, and knowledge all stay on your device. There is no Memex account and no Memex server storing your journal. You bring your own LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.), and your prompts go directly from your phone to that provider — we never see your data.

## Features

### 🎙️ Multi-Modal Recording
- Capture text, images, and voice in a single input flow
- Long-press to record audio, release to send
- Automatic EXIF extraction (timestamp, GPS location) from photos
- On-device OCR and image labeling via Google ML Kit

### 🤖 AI-Powered Organization
- Multi-agent architecture: each agent handles a specific domain (recording organization, card generation, insights, comments, memory summarization, media analysis)
- Automatically generates the most fitting card for each type of record:
  - Life & productivity (task, routine, event, duration, progress) — record todos, habits, schedules and goals
  - Knowledge & media (article, snippet, quote, link, conversation) — capture notes, references and dialogues
  - People & places (person, place) — record contacts and locations with map preview
  - Data & metrics (metric, rating, transaction, spec sheet) — record measurements, reviews and expenses
  - Visual (gallery) — preserve moments through photos
- Auto-tagging, entity extraction, and cross-reference linking
- Conversational AI assistant for discussing any card or topic

### 💡 Knowledge & Insights
- P.A.R.A-based knowledge organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Insight cards that surface connections across records:
  - Charts (trend, bar, radar, bubble, composition, progress ring) — visualize patterns, distributions and goal progress over time
  - Narrative (highlight, contrast, summary) — surface key conclusions, before/after comparisons, and periodic reviews
  - Spatial & temporal (map, route, timeline) — reconstruct where and when things happened
  - Gallery — visual memory from your photos

### 📝 Pure Text & Data Freedom
- **Effortless Archiving**: After AI organization, all your records naturally settle into a series of interconnected Markdown files, making one-click diary and document archiving a breeze.
- **Evolve Alongside AI**: Why Markdown? Because as AI capabilities rapidly advance, only the purest text records can bridge the gap of time and truly keep pace with its evolution. As LLM models strengthen, these simple records will reliably unlock entirely new interactive experiences and profound insights for you in the future.
- **Absolute Freedom to Leave**: Zero vendor lock-in. If you ever feel our product no longer meets your expectations, you can one-click export all your records as standard Markdown files and migrate seamlessly to any note-taking app at zero cost.

### 🔒 Privacy & Local-First
- All data stored locally (filesystem + SQLite)
- App lock with biometric authentication
- No cloud dependency — your data never leaves your device

### 📂 Storage & Backup
- Supports iCloud Drive, Device storage (custom folder) and App storage
- One-tap full backup / restore

### Configure LLM

Memex requires an LLM API key to power its AI features. On first launch:

1. Tap the avatar icon → Model Configuration
2. Select your provider (Gemini / OpenAI / Claude / etc.)
3. Enter your API key and base URL
4. Each agent can be configured with a different model independently

### Configure Location Context

Memex can optionally attach your current city, district, and neighborhood context to agent conversations. This uses device GPS only; IP-based location is not used.

1. Open Personal center → Settings → Location.
2. Turn on "Attach current location to chat".
3. Choose a reverse geocoding provider:
   - OpenStreetMap / Nominatim works without an API key.
   - Amap requires an API key.
4. To use Amap, create an application in the [Amap Open Platform](https://lbs.amap.com/), enable the Web Service API, copy the key, and paste it into the Amap API Key field.
5. Choose the context granularity and freshness window.

For local live tests of Amap reverse geocoding, pass the key through an environment variable instead of committing it:

```bash
AMAP_GEOCODING_TEST_KEY=your_key flutter test test/data/services/geocoding_service_test.dart
```

## 🧩 Custom Agent System

Memex isn't just a recording app — it's a platform that lets you build your own AI agents on your phone.

Every built-in agent in Memex (knowledge extraction, card generation, insight discovery…) runs on the same custom agent infrastructure, and that infrastructure is fully open to you. That means you can create agents with the same capabilities as the built-in ones.

### What You Can Build

- 🎯 **Create agents freely** — Give it a name, pick a host type (Pure mode), and a new agent is ready to go.
- ⚡ **Event-driven triggers** — Choose when your agent activates: on user input, after knowledge extraction, on card creation, on insight generation, or any system event.
- 🧠 **Per-agent LLM configuration** — Each agent can use a different model.
- 📝 **Custom system prompts** — Shape your agent's personality, expertise, and output format with a custom system prompt.
- 📂 **Skill** — Memex adopts the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard. Each agent reads its behavior from a `SKILL.md` file — a folder of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents discover and use on demand.
- 🗂️ **Working directory** — Each agent can be configured with its own workspace. File reads, writes, and listings are scoped to that directory.
- 🚀 **JavaScript execution** — Skills can run JavaScript code, including `fetch()` for HTTP requests. Call external APIs, transform data, scrape web content — all running locally on your device.
- 🔗 **Inter-agent dependency chains** — Define execution order with `dependsOn` to build complex workflows. Agent B waits for Agent A to finish before it starts.
- 🔄 **Sync & async execution modes** — Run agents synchronously (inline, blocking) or asynchronously (queued as background tasks) depending on your workflow needs.
- 🔁 **Auto-retry with configurable limits** — Async agents automatically retry on failure, with a configurable max retry count.

### How It Works

```
System Event (user input, card created, insight generated, ...)
    ↓
Event Bus dispatches to subscribed agents
    ↓
Agent loads SKILL.md + system prompt
    ↓
LLM processes the event with available tools
    ↓
Agent executes actions (file I/O, JavaScript, fetch, ...)
    ↓
Continues to downstream dependent agents and presents results to the user
```

Every agent you create is a first-class citizen — it plugs into the same event bus, uses the same tool system, and has the same capabilities as the built-in agents. The only limit is your imagination.

> 💡 **Learn more about the Skill format**: [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open standard originally developed by Anthropic for packaging agent capabilities. Visit the site to understand how to write SKILL.md files and design agent behaviors.
